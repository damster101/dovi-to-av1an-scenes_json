Python script to create Av1an-compatible scenes.json from Dolby Vision metadata.

Run in local folder of your Dolby Vision video file or extracted RPU, then simply follow the process.

This script uses dovi_tool (what else), and Vapoursynth with lsmash or bestsource, which should be used with Av1an anyway. I only tested it on Linux.
